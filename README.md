# Hospital Analytics Project (SQL)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital patient and treatment data using SQL to understand revenue drivers, high-cost disease segments, and utilization patterns across cities and departments.

## Problem Statement
Hospital data is often scattered across multiple tables, making it difficult to track performance and costs. This project focuses on using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from raw hospital data.

## Objectives
- Analyze patient and treatment data
- Identify high-cost disease segments
- Evaluate doctor and department performance
- Study city-wise revenue contribution

## Tools & Skills Used
- SQL
- MySQL
- Joins, Subqueries, Aggregations, Window Functions
- Data Analysis
- KPI Reporting

## Analysis Performed
- City-wise and department-wise revenue analysis
- Identification of high-cost treatments and disease categories
- Doctor-wise performance evaluation
- Patient distribution and utilization trends

## Files Included
- queries.sql – SQL queries used for analysis
- Optional screenshots of query outputs

## Key Insights
- A small number of disease categories contributed to a large share of total revenue
- Certain cities generated consistently higher hospital revenue
- Doctor performance varied significantly across departments

## KPIs Tracked
- Total hospital revenue
- Revenue by city and department
- Average treatment cost
- High-cost disease contribution to revenue
- Doctor-wise patient count
- Department-wise utilization trends
